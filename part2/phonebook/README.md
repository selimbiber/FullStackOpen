# Phonebook

In this exercise, we created a simple phonebook.

In this phonebook, users can add, update & delete a person as well as their phone number. Person's names are unique, which means that users cannot add names that already exist in the phonebook. A search field is also available in the app to filter the people by their name.

This initial state of the application is stored in a file db.json, which corresponds to a list of users along with their numbers. This file is used by the tool JSON Server which acts as a backend server where the data are stored.

## Start the application

To start an application, do the following:

```
# Install dependencies
$ npm install
# Start the application
$ npm run dev
```

You can then access the app on: http://localhost:3000/
